/// Calculates the derivative of a complex mathematical expression.
///
/// # Arguments
///
/// * `expression` - A string slice that holds the mathematical expression for which the derivative is to be calculated.
///
/// # Returns
///
/// Returns a `Result` which is:
///
/// * `Ok(String)` containing the derivative expression if the input expression is valid and the derivative can be calculated.
/// * `Err(String)` containing an error message if the input expression is invalid or if the derivative cannot be calculated.
///
/// # Note
///
/// This function does not perform symbolic differentiation itself, but parses the expression
/// and returns a placeholder derivative expression for demonstration purposes.
/// In a real-world scenario, this would be replaced with actual logic to parse and differentiate
/// the expression.
